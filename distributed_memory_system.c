    Purpose: A Distributed Memory search algorithm which 
    creates a matrix of the percentages of the presense 
    of keywords and then uses this matrix to find the 
    documents that most closely match the user's search 
    queries by calculating the cosine of the angle between 
    the vector of the search query and the vector of the 
    documents.
